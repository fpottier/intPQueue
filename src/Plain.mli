(**This is a priority queue whose keys are {i low} nonnegative integers. *)

(**This queue is optimized for throughput, that is, speed. When an element
   is extracted out of the queue, the queue may retain a pointer to this
   element. This creates a memory leak: that is, the existence of this
   pointer can prevent the garbage collector from freeing this element. In
   practice, we do not expect this to be a problem, especially in scenarios
   where the queue itself is not long-lived. *)

(**A priority is a nonnegative integer. *)
type priority =
  int

(**A priority queue is an abstract mutable data structure. It can be thought
   of as a bag of elements, where each element carries a certain priority. *)
type 'a t

(**[create()] creates an empty priority queue.

   Time complexity: {m O(1)}. *)
val create: unit -> 'a t

(**[add q x i] inserts the element [x] with priority [i] into the queue [q].

   Time complexity: {m O(1)} (amortized). *)
val add: 'a t -> 'a -> priority -> unit

(**[extract q] extracts an element out of the queue [q] and returns it. This
   element has minimum priority among all of the elements that are currently
   present in the queue. If the queue is empty, [None] is returned.

  Time complexity: {m O(p)}. If the queue is used in a {i monotonic} manner
  (that is, if the priority that is used in every call to {!add} is at least
  as high as the priority of the last element that was returned by
  {!extract}) then the time complexity of {m n} calls to {!extract} is only
  {m O(n+p)}. Indeed, in this monotonic scenario, the cost of scanning the
  queue's main array, so as to find the next element with minimum priority,
  is shared between all invocations of {!extract}. *)
val extract: 'a t -> 'a option

(**[extract' q] extracts an element out of the queue [q] and returns a pair
   of this element and its priority. This element has minimum priority among
   all of the elements that are currently present in the queue. If the queue
   is empty, [None] is returned.

  Time complexity: see {!extract}. *)

(**[is_empty q] tests whether the queue [q] is empty.

   Time complexity: {m O(1)}. *)
val is_empty: 'a t -> bool

(**[cardinal q] returns the number of elements in the queue [q].

   Time complexity: {m O(1)}. *)
val cardinal: 'a t -> int

(**[repeat q yield] repeatedly extracts an element with minimum priority out
   of [q] and passes it to [yield] (which may insert new elements into [q]),
   until [q] is exhausted.

   Time complexity: the total cost of {m n} calls to {!extract} and {m n}
   invocations of the function [yield]. *)
val repeat: 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

(**[iter q yield] enumerates the elements of the queue [q], by increasing
   order of priority, by passing them to the function [yield]. This function
   must not modify the queue [q]. *)
val iter: 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

(**[reset q] empties the queue [q], freeing up the space that the queue
   occupies in memory. The queue [q] becomes identical to a queue that
   has just been created by {!create}.

   Time complexity: {m O(1)}. *)
